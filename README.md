### 💻 What I Do

**Senior Backend Engineer** with **cloud infrastructure** experience, working primarily with **Java/Spring**. Currently expanding my full-stack capabilities.

I build backend systems that solve real problems. From a banking fee aggregator to a WhatsApp bridge for medical appointment reminders, I aim to close the gap between business needs and technical implementation.

### 🔧 What I've Built

**[monitor-comisiones-bancarias](https://github.com/jrusco/monitor-comisiones-bancarias)** •
**Go prototyping** with financial data—aggregates and compares credit card fees across major Argentine banks.

**[codekit](https://github.com/jrusco/codekit)** • TypeScript
**Privacy-first** developer toolkit running entirely in-browser with encrypted session persistence. Security-conscious design meets full-stack capability.

**[whatsapp-bridge](https://github.com/jrusco/whatsapp-bridge)** • JavaScript
**Integration middleware** for forwarding messages to n8n webhooks. The "glue code" that makes business operations work.

### 📡 Currently Exploring

Deepening expertise in **cloud-native** architectures and modern frontend tooling. Working with **Go** for backend services, **React/TypeScript** for UIs, and streamlining deployment pipelines.

Always looking to blend hands-on engineering with the **soft skills** of leadership and client-facing roles.
