I build backend systems that solve real problems. From banking fee aggregators to WhatsApp automation bridges, I bridge the gap between business needs and technical implementation.

Senior backend engineer with cloud infrastructure experience, working primarily in Go and Java/Spring, expanding into full-stack capabilities.

### What I've Built

**[monitor-comisiones-bancarias](https://github.com/jrusco/monitor-comisiones-bancarias)** • Go
Aggregates and compares credit card transaction fees across major Argentine banks. Built in a day, demonstrates rapid prototyping and real-world problem solving with financial data.

**[codekit](https://github.com/jrusco/codekit)** • TypeScript
Privacy-first developer toolkit running entirely in-browser with encrypted session persistence. Shows security-conscious design and full-stack capability.

**[whatsapp-bridge](https://github.com/jrusco/whatsapp-bridge)** • JavaScript
Middleware for handling and forwarding messages to n8n webhooks. Integration work connecting different systems - the kind of "glue code" that makes business operations work.

### Currently Exploring

Deepening expertise in cloud-native architectures and modern frontend tooling. Working with Go for backend services, React/TypeScript for UIs, and exploring distributed systems patterns.

Looking for opportunities to blend hands-on engineering with technical leadership.
